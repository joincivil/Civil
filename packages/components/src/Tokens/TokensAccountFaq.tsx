                Ether (ETH) is the cryptocurrency for the Ethereum blockchain. Gas is the transaction cost of performing
                actions like adding content, or buying Civil tokens. Gas costs are variable. Like any currency, Ether
                (ETH) fluctuates in value with the market.
              </p>
              <p>
                You will have to pay gas in Ether (ETH), which you can purchase via MetaMask and a cryptocurrency
                exchange such as Coinbase.

          <p>
            When you perform actions like buying or selling tokens, you need to pay the cost of that computing effort.
            That payment is calculated in gas. Think about it like paying for a stamp on an envelope or paying for the
            shipping costs of sending a package. Gas can only be paid for with ETH.
          </p>
          <p>ETH is used to also purchase Civil tokens (CVL) from an exchange or from Civil.</p>

            To complete your membership contribution and receive Civil tokens (CVL), you must buy Ether (ETH). Then you
            will be able to exchange ETH for CVL. Unfortunately at this time, you can’t use USD or local currencies to
            directly buy Civil tokens. You must first convert local currencies into ETH using an exchange like Coinbase
            or Gemini. You will need to have your debit card or bank account details handy, as well as your passport to{" "}

            If you purchase Ether (ETH) in Coinbase using your Bank Account, Coinbase uses a ACH (Automated Clearing
            House, which is governed by the Federal Reserve) bank transfer system for U.S. customers, and it can take
            3-5 business days for funds to transfer from your bank.

            AirSwap is a secure decentralized, peer-to-peer token trading network built on the Ethereum blockchain. It
            is an independent entity. Airswap does not charge any of its own fees on each trade. You only have to pay a
            Gas fee for each transaction on Ethereum. You can learn more about Airswap{" "}

            You’ll be able to purchase Civil tokens (CVL) using Ethereum (ETH) in Airswap. Airswap will open its own
            interface to allow you to use ETH to buy CVL. You will need to use a wallet such as Metamask to connect and
            buy those tokens. Since Airswap is based on a trading network, the prices of Civil tokens (CVL) are based on
            the current market rate and can fluctuate.

            We believe it is critical to ensure that only people who aim to advance Civil’s mission should possess Civil
            tokens. Speculators have the ability to affect the price of Civil tokens, which decouples the value from the
            actual work being done by real participants in the network.
          </p>
          <p>In order to mitigate this, we restrict members from transferring tokens under certain conditions.</p>
          <p>What are the restrictions?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Anybody can receive tokens. There are only restrictions on SENDING tokens, but never on RECEIVING.</li>
            <li>
              All token holders must complete the “Civil Tutorial” to use, send or sell their tokens. This ensures that
              you know how to safely use Civil tokens and that you will to use them for their intended purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              After you complete the tutorial, you may send Civil tokens to newsrooms on the Registry. However, until
              your account is unlocked, so you cannot sell or transfer Civil tokens to anyone else.
            </li>
            <li>
              In order to unlock your tokens, you must transfer tokens into the voting contract on the Civil Registry,
              demonstrating your intent to be an active participant. More details on the unlocking process are provided
              below.
            </li>
            <li>After your tokens are unlocked, you are allowed to freely transfer or sell your Civil tokens.</li>
