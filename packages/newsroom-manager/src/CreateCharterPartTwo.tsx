          Civil’s Registry is based on transparency and trust, so we ask newsrooms to be as open and clear as possible
          in answering the following questions. The aim is to ensure the Civil community is able to make an informed
          decision about new applicants and uphold the highest standards of journalism. We ask that any newsroom
          applying to the registry provide the information below to the best of their ability.

          Registry.{" "}
