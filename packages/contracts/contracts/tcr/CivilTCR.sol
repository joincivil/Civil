@title TCR with appeallate functionality and restrictions on application 
@author Nick Reynolds - nick@joincivil.com
@notice The CivilTCR is a TCR with restrictions (contracts must have IACL
implementation, and only the ACL superuser of a contract can apply on behalf of that contract)
and an appeallate entity that can overturn challenges if someone requests an appeal, and a process
by which granted appeals can be vetoed by a supermajority vote
"Listing" refers to the data associated with an address at any stage of the lifecycle (e.g.
"Listing in Application", "Listing in Challenge", "Listing on Whitelist", "Denied Listing", etc).
