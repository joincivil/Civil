@title CivilTCR - Token Curated Registry with Appeallate Functionality and Restrictions on Application
@author Nick Reynolds - nick@civil.co / engineering@civil.co
@notice The CivilTCR is a TCR with restrictions (address applied for must be a contract with Owned
implementated, and only the owner of a contract can apply on behalf of that contract), an appeallate entity that can
overturn challenges if someone requests an appeal, and a process by which granted appeals can be vetoed by a supermajority vote.
A Granted Appeal reverses the result of the challenge vote (including which parties are considered the winners & receive rewards).
A successful Appeal Challenge reverses the result of the Granted Appeal (again, including the winners).
