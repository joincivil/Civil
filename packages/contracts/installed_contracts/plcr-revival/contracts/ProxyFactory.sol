* Shoutouts:
* 
* Bytecode origin https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6ic49q/any_assembly_programmers_willing_to_write_a/dj5ceuw/
* Modified version of Vitalik's https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6c1jui/delegatecall_forwarders_how_to_save_5098_on/
* Credits to Jorge Izquierdo (@izqui) for coming up with this design here: https://gist.github.com/izqui/7f904443e6d19c1ab52ec7f5ad46b3a8
* Credits to Stefan George (@Georgi87) for inspiration for many of the improvements from Gnosis Safe: https://github.com/gnosis/gnosis-safe-contracts
* 
* This version has many improvements over the original @izqui's library like using REVERT instead of THROWing on failed calls.
* It also implements the awesome design pattern for initializing code as seen in Gnosis Safe Factory: https://github.com/gnosis/gnosis-safe-contracts/blob/master/contracts/ProxyFactory.sol
* but unlike this last one it doesn't require that you waste storage on both the proxy and the proxied contracts (v. https://github.com/gnosis/gnosis-safe-contracts/blob/master/contracts/Proxy.sol#L8 & https://github.com/gnosis/gnosis-safe-contracts/blob/master/contracts/GnosisSafe.sol#L14)
* 
* 
* v0.0.2
* The proxy is now only 60 bytes long in total. Constructor included.
* No functionalities were added. The change was just to make the proxy leaner.
* 
* v0.0.3
* Thanks @dacarley for noticing the incorrect check for the subsequent call to the proxy. ðŸ™Œ
* Note: I'm creating a new version of this that doesn't need that one call.
*       Will add tests and put this in its own repository soonâ„¢. 
* 
* v0.0.4
* All the merit in this fix + update of the factory is @dacarley 's. ðŸ™Œ
* Thank you! ðŸ˜„
*
* Potential updates can be found at https://gist.github.com/GNSPS/ba7b88565c947cfd781d44cf469c2ddb
